**In PHYS-CORE-005 (The Braid Behind the Law), ρ_lock and ℛ_braid are defined as:**

- ℛ_braid = Σ_{⟨i,j⟩} ΔB_ij, where ΔB_ij = 1 − **v**_i · **v**_j — so it's a scalar sum of pairwise vector misalignment across a neighborhood. It lives in the space of *coherence vector fields*.
- ρ_lock(θ, t) = ∫_Δt ∇²_θ ℂ(x, t) · W(x, θ) dx — the angular curvature of the coherence field weighted by a window function W. It's an *observable diagnostic quantity*, essentially a measure of how much phase space is in tight braid configuration at a given time.
- The inverse relationship stated in VR-1 is: ρ_lock↑ ⟹ ℛ_braid↓. That is: high lock density (vectors aligned, determinism emerging) corresponds to low total braid divergence. This is a consistency check, not a derived identity.

**In the Bloch manifold document, braid curvature is defined as:**

- B^a_{bc} = ∇_b η^a_c − ∇_c η^a_b, where η is a natural transformation between recursive projection functors F and G on Hilbert sections ℋ_k = L²(L_k). This is a genuine *tensor* on the recursive Bloch category — antisymmetric in b, c, living on the fiber tower.
- The coherence energy is ℋ_k = ∫_{L_k} |B|² dμ_k.
- Ω_total = Σ_{k=1}^∞ π_k* F_k, the global braid curvature accumulated across all levels via pullback.

**So here is the seam precisely:**

PHYS-CORE-005's ℛ_braid is a scalar computed from pairwise dot products of coherence vectors — it's essentially a discrete graph-level quantity. The Bloch document's B^a_{bc} is a proper differential-geometric curvature tensor on a Fréchet manifold. These are genuinely different mathematical objects that are *conceptually* the same thing (both measure "how misaligned is the braid"), but the document that introduces the tensor form (the Bloch manifold) doesn't explicitly show how B^a_{bc} reduces to or generalizes ℛ_braid in any limit.

Specifically, what's missing is something like: *in the case where the fiber tower collapses to a single layer and η becomes a field of coherence vectors **v**_i, does |B|² dμ reduce to Σ ΔB_ij?* If yes, that's a clean one-paragraph bridging proposition that would tie the two layers together. If the relationship is more subtle — say ρ_lock is the projection of ℋ_k onto the angular observable basis — that derivation needs to be made explicit.

The PHYS-CORE-005 verification recipe VR-1 treats the inverse relationship between ρ_lock and ℛ_braid as something you "confirm" empirically or by checking sign consistency. But in the Bloch manifold document that relationship needs to be a *theorem*, because the entire Navier–Stokes regularity argument rests on ℋ_k being bounded — and ℋ_k is defined through B, not through ρ_lock. If a reader wants to connect the diagnostic telemetry (ρ_lock streams, ℛ_braid streams) from PHYS-CORE-005 to the formal boundedness condition in the Bloch document, there's currently no derivational path to walk.

---

PHYS-CORE-005 doesn't need to change — it's doing its job correctly as a layer below. The braid vectors, ρ_lock, and ℛ_braid are defined cleanly there, and the VR-1 consistency check is appropriate at that layer's level of formalism.

The bridging work belongs entirely in the Bloch manifold document, and it's actually fairly localized. You'd want to add something in the neighborhood of §3.3.2 (where B^a_{bc} is first defined) or as a dedicated bridging subsection between §3.3.2 and §3.3.3. The content would need to do three things:

First, show the **single-layer reduction** — that when the fiber tower is truncated to depth k=0 and η reduces to a coherence vector field **v**_i, B^a_{bc} recovers ℛ_braid from PHYS-CORE-005 in the discrete limit. That's the "these are the same object at different levels of abstraction" step.

Second, establish the **ρ_lock correspondence** — showing that ρ_lock(θ, t) as defined in PHYS-CORE-005 (the angular curvature integral ∫ ∇²_θ ℂ · W dx) is a projection of ℋ_k = ∫ |B|² dμ_k onto an angular observable basis. This makes ρ_lock a *measurable shadow* of the deeper geometric quantity ℋ_k rather than an independent definition.

Third, a short **corollary** stating that the inverse relationship ρ_lock↑ ⟹ ℛ_braid↓ (currently just a verification recipe in VR-1) follows as a consequence of this correspondence, promoting it from an empirical consistency check to a derived result.

The nice thing is this bridging section would actually *strengthen* the BKM regularity argument in §3.3.4.1, because it closes the loop between the abstract boundedness condition on ℋ_k and the observable diagnostic streams that an experimentalist would actually measure. Right now those two things are in parallel — after the bridge they're in series.
