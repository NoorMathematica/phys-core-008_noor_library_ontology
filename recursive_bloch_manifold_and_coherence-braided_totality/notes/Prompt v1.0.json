  "_abstract": "This document presents a fully self-contained formalization of recursive Bloch manifold geometry structured as a coherence-braided totality. It defines a fiber tower recursion model, derives braid curvature accumulation, introduces a coherence functional ℂ as an intrinsic curvature contraction, and establishes smoothness conditions for Navier–Stokes-type dynamics under bounded recursive coherence. All axioms and constructions required for interpretation are defined internally.",
