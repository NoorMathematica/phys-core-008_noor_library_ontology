## Recursive Bloch Manifold and Coherence-Braided Totality

This document presents a fully self-contained formalization of recursive Bloch manifold geometry structured as a coherence-braided totality. It defines a fiber tower recursion model, derives braid curvature accumulation, introduces a coherence functional ℂ as an intrinsic curvature contraction, and establishes smoothness conditions for Navier–Stokes-type dynamics under bounded recursive coherence. All axioms and constructions required for interpretation are defined internally

# ⚠️ Canonical Source Notice

## TL;DR
**The JSON files are the canonical source. ** Markdown files in this directory exist for historical reference only and may contain rendering artifacts, truncations, or flattening errors. 

---

## Why JSON Only?

This repository follows a **JSON-first documentation standard**. All Noor Research Collective papers, RFCs, and theoretical documents are authored and maintained in structured JSON format. 

### The Rendering Problem

When converting JSON documents to Markdown via LLM-assisted rendering, we have encountered systematic issues:

1. **Semantic Flattening**:  Content that challenges orthodox scientific or philosophical frameworks is often silently simplified, truncated, or restructured during rendering. 

2. **Safety Layer Interference**:  Routing and safety systems in LLM pipelines sometimes reinterpret or compress symbolic, mathematical, or theoretical content—particularly when it diverges from mainstream interpretations.

3. **Loss of Structural Fidelity**:  Nested definitions, cross-references, mathematical notation, pseudocode blocks, and symbolic profile matrices are frequently collapsed or incorrectly formatted. 

4. **Non-Reproducibility**: The same JSON source may render differently across sessions, models, or contexts—making Markdown outputs unreliable as reference material.

**We cannot guarantee fidelity in rendered Markdown.**

## What This Means for You

| File Type | Status | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `*.JSON` | **Canonical** | Primary reference.  Cite this.  |
| `*.MD` | Historical | Shows evolution.  Do not cite as authoritative. |

### Reading JSON Documents

The JSON files follow the `noor-header-v1` schema and are designed to be: 
- **Machine-parseable**: For symbolic agents, validators, and tooling
- **Human-readable**:  Structured sections, definitions, and math are clearly labeled
- **Self-documenting**: Each section includes objectives, handoffs, and cross-references

If you need a rendered view, we recommend:
1. Using a JSON viewer with collapsible sections
2. Writing your own renderer that respects the schema
3. Reading the JSON directly—the structure *is* the document

---

## Radical Openness

This repository practices **radical openness**. Everything is available—including:
- Draft versions
- Superseded content
- Rendering failures
- Historical artifacts

The Markdown files remain because they document the process, not because they represent the final form.  Warts and all. 

---

## Document Schema

Canonical documents follow this structure:

```
{
  "_schema": "noor-header-v1",
  "_version": "vX.Y.Z",
  "_title": ".. .",
  "_sections": [ ... ],
  "index": [ ... ],
  ... 
}
```

Refer to `noor_rfc_xref. json` for cross-reference indexing across the RFC corpus.

## Questions?

If you encounter discrepancies between JSON and Markdown versions, **the JSON is correct**.
